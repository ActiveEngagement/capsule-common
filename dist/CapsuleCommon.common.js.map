The throttled function comes with a `cancel`\n * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to\n * immediately invoke them. Provide `options` to indicate whether `func`\n * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`\n * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the\n * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n * result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the
